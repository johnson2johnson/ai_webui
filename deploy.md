Absolutely. Here’s a concise, no-fluff guide to signing up for GitHub and using it (with your custom domain) to host a website you’re building locally (like with npm run dev, likely a React/Vite/Next.js app).

⸻

✅ Step 1: Sign up for GitHub
	1.	Go to https://github.com
	2.	Click Sign up.
	3.	Follow the steps to create a username/password and verify email.

⸻

✅ Step 2: Push Your Project to GitHub

Assuming your website is in a local folder:

cd /path/to/your/project
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin master  # or main

If your project is already a Git repo, skip git init.

⸻

✅ Step 3: Build Your Site

Your npm run dev is for development only. For deployment:

npm run build

This creates a production-ready build (often in dist/ or out/ or .next/, depending on the framework).

⸻

✅ Step 4: Deploy to GitHub Pages

Option 1: Static HTML (e.g., Vite, React with npm run build)

Use gh-pages:

npm install --save-dev gh-pages

Add this to package.json:

"homepage": "https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name",
"scripts": {
  "predeploy": "npm run build",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
}

Then deploy:

npm run deploy

Option 2: Next.js (static export)

next build && next export

Then deploy the out/ folder using gh-pages as above.

⸻

✅ Step 5: Use a Custom Domain
	1.	Create a file named CNAME in your public/ or root of dist/ folder:

www.yourdomain.com

	2.	Add or update DNS records at your domain registrar:
	•	Type: A
	•	Name: @
	•	Value: 185.199.108.153 (and others: .154, .155, .156 – GitHub’s IPs)
	•	Or use a CNAME to yourusername.github.io if using a subdomain
	3.	On GitHub:
	•	Go to your repo → Settings → Pages
	•	Set the source to gh-pages branch (or /docs if using main)
	•	Add the custom domain under “Custom domain” and save

⸻

✅ Summary Checklist
	•	GitHub account and repo
	•	Build site: npm run build
	•	Deploy with gh-pages or manually push build files
	•	DNS configured for custom domain
	•	GitHub Pages settings updated

Let me know if you want this for Next.js, Vite, or plain HTML/JS, and I’ll give exact edits.
